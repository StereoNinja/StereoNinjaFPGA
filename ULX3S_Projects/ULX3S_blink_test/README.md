## Download programmer

Download fujprog for your OS [latest version of fujprog](https://github.com/kost/fujprog/releases).

Extract fujprog to "any-folder" on your drive

```
MacOS: export PATH=[path-to-fujprog]:$PATH
Linux: export PATH=[path-to-fujprog]:$PATH
Windows Powershell: $ENV:PATH = "[path-to-fujprog];" + $ENV:PATH
Windows cmd.exe: PATH=[path-to-fujprog];%PATH%
```
## Windows sugestion

On windows maybe best solution would be to install WSL 2 first, installing Ubuntu/Debian, and then following your instructions for Linux setup

## Fujprog

You may want to rename fujprog name, for example on linux just rename fujprog-v46-linux-x64 to fujprog

```
cd path-to-fujprog
mv fujprog-v46-linux-x64 fujprog
```

## Uploading

Upload blink led for your board version

```
git clone https://github.com/ulx3s/blink.git
cd blink
fujprog blink_85f.bit
```

On linux you may need to add udev rule

## Build your own blink LED

This blinky is based on the [ULX3S-Blinky project](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/ULX3S-Blinky) from @Doctorwkt. This example blinks an LED using FPGA code.

It is assumed the yosys, nextpnr toolchain has been already installed. If not, see [instructions here](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md#precompiled-opensource-tools-for-all-platforms)

First you will need to install verilator

```
sudo apt-get install verilator
```

Default size in Makefile is 85F - you can change it here:

https://github.com/ulx3s/blink/blob/main/Makefile#L69

```
make clean
make ulx3s.bit
make prog
```
